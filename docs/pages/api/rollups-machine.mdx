# RollupsMachine

## Interface

The `RollupsMachine` interface provides the main methods for interacting with a Cartesi rollup machine. It exposes generator-based methods for advance and inspect requests, as well as methods for shutting down and storing the machine state.

```ts
interface RollupsMachine {
    advance(input: Buffer): IterableIterator<AdvanceYield>;
    inspect(query: Buffer): IterableIterator<Buffer>;
    shutdown(): void;
    store(dir: string): RollupsMachine;
}
```

## advance

Sends an advance request to the machine. Yields outputs, reports, and progress updates as they are produced.

```ts
advance(input: Buffer): IterableIterator<AdvanceYield>

type AdvanceYield =
    | { type: "output"; data: Buffer }
    | { type: "report"; data: Buffer }
    | { type: "progress"; data: number };
```

- Throws `RollupsInputRejectedError` if the input is rejected.
- Throws `RollupsFatalError` for fatal machine errors.

## inspect

Sends an inspect request to the machine. Yields each report (as a Buffer) produced by the inspect request.

```ts
inspect(query: Buffer): IterableIterator<Buffer>
```

- Throws `RollupsInputRejectedError` if the query is rejected.
- Throws `RollupsFatalError` for fatal machine errors.

## shutdown

Shuts down the underlying machine/server.

```ts
shutdown(): void
```

## store

Stores the current machine state to the specified directory.

```ts
store(dir: string): RollupsMachine
```
