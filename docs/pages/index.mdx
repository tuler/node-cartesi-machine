# Cartesi Machine + Node.js

The [Cartesi machine emulator](https://github.com/cartesi/machine-emulator) is distributed as a C dynamic library, and can be used from any programming language that provides some kind of C code integration. Node.js is no exception, and this library provides a binding using FFI through the [koffi](https://koffi.dev) library.

It provides a fully typed and ergonomic TypeScript API for the Cartesi Machine C API and the Cartesi Machine JSON-RPC API, which allows you to create, manage, and interact with local or remote Cartesi machines from TypeScript/JavaScript applications.

## Features

- **Comprehensive**: Complete API, for any use case, including [local](/local) and [remote](/remote) machines;
- **Full Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript definitions for all C API functions and types;
- **High-Level Wrapper**: Easy-to-use [CartesiMachine](/api/cartesi-machine) and [RemoteCartesiMachine](/api/remote-cartesi-machine) interfaces that wraps the C API;
- **Error Handling**: Easy [error handling](/error-handling) with detailed error messages.
