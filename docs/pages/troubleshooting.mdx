# Troubleshooting

## Can't find dynamic library

This library works on Linux and macOS.
It needs the following dynamic libraries to be installed in the system:

:::code-group

```bash [Linux]
libcartesi.so
libcartesi_jsonrpc.so
```

```bash [macOS]
libcartesi.dylib
libcartesi_jsonrpc.dylib
```
:::

The libraries above are searched in the following directories by default:

```ts
const defaultPaths = [
    // System library paths
    "/usr/lib",
    "/usr/local/lib",
    "/opt/homebrew/lib", // macOS Homebrew
    "/opt/local/lib", // macOS MacPorts
    // Current directory
    ".",
    // Relative to current working directory
    join(process.cwd(), "lib"),
    join(process.cwd(), "build"),
];
```

On Linux it also uses the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, which is expected to be a list of directories separated by `:`.
On macOS the environment variable names used are `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`.

## Error spawning server

The address does not support DNS.
So addresses like `localhost:0` are not supported, use `127.0.0.1:0` instead.
