# Error Handling

Many of the API methods can raise a `MachineError` exception that provides visibility to the error code and a description.

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/error-handling.ts] 
```

Executing the code above without a Cartesi machine stored at `./snapshot` produces the following output:

```shell
-11 unable to open './snapshot/config.json' for reading: No such file or directory
````

:::info
The `InvalidArgument` error handling above is only illustrative of the defined types, it doesn't really make sense in a production code.
